This is the software for the book:

	Assimilating the Raspberry Pi

The current snapshot of the git repository is available by executing
the command:

$ git clone git@github.com:ve3wwg/raspberry_pi.git

The source code will be deposited into the subdirectory ./raspberry_pi

On the Raspberry Pi, simply CD to this directory and type:

$ make

Or you may cd into any project subdirectory and type make:

$ cd ./bipolar
$ make

If you make changes to the source code and you want to rebuild 
completely from scratch, you can use:

$ make clobber all

Enjoy.
